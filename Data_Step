/*
Automatic Data Step Variable
SAS dataset has these veriabls in the data step: 
_N_
*/

/*
Dataset Options:
1  rename variables
2  select only the first or last n observations for processing
3  drop variables from processing or from the output dataset
4  specify a password for a dataset

Most SAS data set options apply to either input or output SAS data sets in DATA steps or procedure (PROC) steps. 
If a data set option is associated with an input data set, the action applies to the data set that is being read. 
If the data set option appears in the DATA statement or after an output data set specification in a PROC step, SAS applies the action to the output data set. 

When data set options appear in input and output data sets in the same DATA or PROC step, 
SAS first applies data set options to input data sets. 
Then SAS evaluates programming statements or applies data set options to output data sets.

Timing can also be an issue in some cases. 
For example, if you are using KEEP= and RENAME= on a data set that is specified in the SET statement, 
KEEP= needs to use the original variable names. SAS processes KEEP= before the data set is read. 
The new names that are specified in RENAME= apply to the programming statements that follow the SET statement.

Many system options and data set options share the same name and have the same function. 
System options remain in effect for all DATA steps and PROC steps in a SAS job or session.
The data set option overrides the system option for the data set in the step in which it appears.
  eg:
  options obs=100; system options    
  data final;
     set two(obs=5) three;  dataset options
  run;

Syntax DATA libref.dataset(OPTIONS);  eg: DATA old(rename=(date=Start_Date));

Data Set Control	
ALTER= password	                                      - Assigns an ALTER= password to a SAS file that prevents users from replacing or deleting the file, and enables access to a read- and write-protected file.
COMPRESS= NO | YES | CHAR | BINARY                    - Specifies how observations are compressed in a new output SAS data set. In general, COMPRESS=CHAR provides good compression when single bytes repeat, eg:"aaaaaa"; COMPRESS=BINARY provides good compression when strings of bytes repeat, eg:"abcabc".
DLDMGACTION= FAIL | ABORT | REPAIR | NOINDEX | PROMPT - Specifies the action to take when a SAS data set in a SAS library is detected as damaged. 
                                                        FAIL:stops the step and issues an error message to the log immediately. This is the default for batch mode.
                                                        ABORT:stops the step, issues an error message to the log, and terminates the SAS session.
                                                        REPAIR:attempts to automatically repair a damaged data set on the next attempt to open the damaged file. The data set might truncate at the point of damage. The REPAIR option re-creates the index or indexes. If the damage is too severe, the auto repair attempt might not be successful.
                                                        NOINDEX:automatically repairs the data file without the indexes and integrity constraints. 
                                                        PROMPT:displays a dialog box that asks you to select the FAIL, ABORT, REPAIR, or NOINDEX action.
ENCRYPT= AES | AES2 | NO | YES                        - No by default. Specifies whether to encrypt an output SAS data set.
                                                        AES | AES2: encryption methodology. must use encryptkey=password to assign password
                                                        YES: must use read=password to assign password
ENCRYPTKEY= password                                  - Specifies a key value for AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption.
                                                        1 to 64 bytes; not supported in a DATA step that runs in CAS; Use only with SAS 9.4 or later; Use only with AES-encrypted data files.
READ= password                                        - Assigns a READ= password to a SAS file that prevents users from reading the file, unless they enter the password.
                                                        not supported in a DATA step that runs in CAS.
INDEX= (variable(s) </UNIQUE> </NOMISS> )             - Defines an index for a new output SAS data set.
                                                        data new(index=(ssn));
                                                        data new(index=(cityst=(city state)));
                                                        data new(index=(ssn /unique));
                                                        data new(index=(ssn /nomiss));
                                                        data new(index=(ssn /unique/nomiss cityst=(city state) /unique/nomiss));
LABEL= 'label'                                        - Specifies a label for a SAS data set.
                                                        a text string of up to 256 bytes. 
                                                        If the label text contains single quotation marks, enclose the label in double quotation marks. 
                                                        To remove a label from a data set, assign a blank space that is enclosed in quotation marks to the label.
                                                        You can also use two single quotation marks in the label text and enclose the string in single quotation marks.
PW= password                                          - Assigns a READ, WRITE, and ALTER password to a SAS file, and enables access to a password-protected SAS file.
                                                        password must be a valid SAS name, which limits the password to eight characters and is case-insensitive.
REPEMPTY= YES | NO                                    - Specifies whether a new, empty data set can overwrite an existing SAS data set.
                                                        By default is YES. Suggest to set it NO
REPLACE= NO | YES                                     - Specifies whether a new SAS data set that contains data can overwrite an existing data set.
                                                        Use REPLACE=YES and REPEMPTY=NO for the convenience of replacing existing data sets with new ones that contain data.
SORTEDBY= by-clause</ collate-name> | _NULL_          - Specifies how a data set is currently sorted. No need to sort the dataset again 
                                                        by-clause: names the variables and options that you use in a BY statement in a PROC SORT step.
                                                        collate-name: names the collating sequence that is used for the sort. By default, the collating sequence is that of your operating environment. A slash (/) must precede the collating sequence. 
                                                        _NULL_: removes any existing sort indicator.
TYPE= data-set-type                                   - Specifies the data set type for a specially structured SAS data set.
                                                        You can use the CONTENTS procedure to determine the type of data set.
                                                        Most SAS data sets do not have a specified type. 
                                                        However, there are several specially structured SAS data sets that are used by some SAS/STAT procedures. 
                                                        Some of the special data sets are CORR, COV, SSPC, EST, and FACTOR.
WRITE= write-password                                 - Assigns a WRITE= password to a SAS file that prevents users from writing to a file, unless the users enter the password.
                                                        must be a valid SAS name.
Observation Control

IDXWHERE= Data Set Option	Specifies whether SAS uses an index search or a sequential search to match the conditions of a WHERE expression.
Variable Control	
DROP= Data Set Option	For an input data set, excludes the specified variables from processing; for an output data set, excludes the specified variables from being written to the data set.
KEEP= Data Set Option	For an input data set, specifies the variables to process; for an output data set, specifies the variables to write to the data set.
RENAME= Data Set Option	Changes the name of a variable.
