Global Statement

/*
filename sales 'your-input-file';
libname allmine (v9 v6 'some-filename');
%include 'MYFILE';
*/

A SAS global statement is a string of SAS keywords, SAS names, special characters, and operators that instructs SAS to perform an operation or that gives information to SAS. 
Each SAS global statement ends with a semicolon and can be used anywhere in a SAS program.
Global statements are not executable; they take effect as soon as SAS compiles program statements.

Data Access: Associates reference names with SAS libraries, SAS catalogs, external files and output devices, and accesses remote files.	
FILENAME Statement	                              - Associates a SAS fileref with an external file or an output device, disassociates a fileref and external file, or lists attributes of external files.
FILENAME fileref <device-type> 'external-file' <ENCODING='encoding-value'> <options> <operating-environment-options>;
FILENAME fileref <device-type> <options> <operating-environment-options >;
FILENAME fileref CLEAR | _ALL_ CLEAR;
FILENAME fileref LIST | _ALL_ LIST ;
fileref: 1 to 8 bytes

eg:
filename sales 'your-input-file';
data jansales;
    infile sales;  /* specifying a fileref */  
    input salesrep $20. +6 jansales febsales marsales;
run;

filename extfile 'external-file' encoding="utf-8"; 
data myfiles.unicode;
   infile extfile;
   input Make $ Model $ Year;
run;

LIBNAME Statement	                                - Associates or disassociates a SAS library with a libref (a shortcut name), clears one or all librefs, lists the characteristics of a SAS library, concatenates SAS libraries, or concatenates SAS catalogs.
LIBNAME libref <engine> 'SAS-library' < libname-options > <engine-host-options>;
LIBNAME libref CLEAR | _ALL_ CLEAR ;
LIBNAME libref LIST | _ALL_ LIST;
LIBNAME libref <engine> (library-specification-1 <...library-specification-n>) <libname-options>;
libref: 1 to 8 bytes
'SAS-library': must be the physical name for the SAS library. The physical name is the name that is recognized by the operating environment. Enclose the physical name in single or double quotation marks.
library-specification: 'SAS-library', libref
CLEAR: disassociates one or more currently assigned librefs.
_ALL_: specifies that the CLEAR or LIST argument applies to all currently assigned librefs.
LIST: writes the attributes of one or more SAS libraries to the SAS log.
libname-options: ACCESS=READONLY|TEMP 

eg:
libname sales 'SAS-library';
libname allmine (v9 v6 'some-filename');

Information: Gives SAS additional information about the program data vector.
MISSING character(s);                             - Assigns characters in your input data to represent special missing values for numeric data.
character: is the value in your input data that represents a special missing value.
The MISSING statement usually appears within a DATA step, but it is global in scope.

eg:
data survey;
   missing a r;
   input id answer;
   datalines;
001 2
002 R
003 1
004 A
005 2
;

Log Control: Alters the appearance of the SAS log.
*message;/*message*/	                            - Comment. Specifies the purpose of the statement or program.
PAGE                                              - Skips to a new page in the SAS log.
RESETLINE         	                              - Restarts the program line numbers in the SAS log to 1.
SKIP <n>;     	                                  - Creates a/<n> blank line(s) in the SAS log.

Operating Environment: Accesses the operating environment directly.	
X <'operating-environment-command'>;              - Issues an operating-environment command from within a SAS session.

Output Control: Adds titles and footnotes to your SAS output; delivers output in a variety of formats.
FOOTNOTE <n> <ods-format-options> <'text'|“text”>;- Writes up to 10 lines of text at the bottom of the procedure or DATA step output.
TITLE <n> <ods-format-options> <'text'|“text”>;   - Specifies title lines for SAS output.
ods-format-options:
BOLD: specifies that the title text is bold font weight.
COLOR | C =color: specifies the title text color.
BCOLOR=color: specifies the background color of the title block.
FONT | F =font-face: specifies the font to use. If you supply multiple fonts, then the destination device uses the first one that is installed on your system.
HEIGHT | H =dimension | size : specifies the size of the font for titles
ITALIC: specifies that the title text is in italics.
JUSTIFY | J= CENTER | C | LEFT | L | RIGHT | R
UNDERLIN | U = 0 | 1 | 2 | 3: specifies whether the subsequent text is underlined. Value 0 indicates no underlining. Values 1, 2, and 3 indicate underlining.

Program Control: Governs how SAS processes your SAS program.
CHECKPOINT EXECUTE_ALWAYS                         - Indicates to execute the DATA step or PROC step that immediately follows without considering the checkpoint-restart data.
DM <window> 'command(s)' <window> <CONTINUE> ;    - Submits SAS Program Editor, Log, Procedure Output or text editor commands as SAS statements.
ENDSAS          	                                - Terminates a SAS job or session after the current DATA or PROC step executes.
%INCLUDE |	%INC source(s) </<SOURCE2> <S2=length> <operating-environment-options> >;
                                                  - Brings a SAS programming statement, data lines, or both, into a current SAS program.
%include 'MYFILE';
filename in1 'MYFILE'; %inc in1;
filename storage 'aggregate-storage-location'; %inc storage(file-1,file-2,file-3);%inc storage("file-1.txt","file-2.dat","file-3.cat");
%include 1 5 9-12 13:16; /*This %INCLUDE statement causes SAS to process lines 1, 5, 9 through 12, and 13 through 16 as if you had entered them again from your keyboard.*/

%LIST <n <:m | − m> >;                            - Displays lines that are entered in the current session.
%RUN          	                                  - Ends source statements following a %INCLUDE * statement.
LOCK libref<.member-name<.member-type | .entry-name.entry-type>> <LIST | QUERY | SHOW | CLEAR | NOMSG>;	
                                                  - Acquires, lists, or releases an exclusive lock on an existing SAS file.
RUN <CANCEL>;	                                    - Executes the previously entered SAS statements.
CANCEL: terminates the current step without executing it. SAS prints a message that indicates that the step was not executed.

SASFILE <libref.> member-name<.member-type> <(password-option(s))> OPEN | LOAD | CLOSE;
                                                  - Opens a SAS data set and allocates enough buffers to hold the entire file in memory.

OPTIONS option(s);                                - Specifies or changes the value of one or more SAS system options.
