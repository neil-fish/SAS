Global Statement

A SAS global statement is a string of SAS keywords, SAS names, special characters, and operators that instructs SAS to perform an operation or that gives information to SAS. 
Each SAS global statement ends with a semicolon and can be used anywhere in a SAS program.
Global statements are not executable; they take effect as soon as SAS compiles program statements.

FILENAME Statement	                              - Associates a SAS fileref with an external file or an output device, disassociates a fileref and external file, or lists attributes of external files.

LIBNAME Statement	                                - Associates or disassociates a SAS library with a libref (a shortcut name), clears one or all librefs, lists the characteristics of a SAS library, concatenates SAS libraries, or concatenates SAS catalogs.
LIBNAME Statement, CVP Engine	                    - Associates a libref for the character variable padding (CVP) engine to expand character variable lengths so that character data truncation does not occur when a file requires transcoding.
LIBNAME Statement, JMP Engine	                    - Associates a libref with a JMP data table and enables you to read and write JMP data tables.
LIBNAME Statement, JSON Engine                    - Provides read-only sequential access to JSON data.
LIBNAME Statement, WebDAV Server                  - Access	Associates a libref with a SAS library and enables access to a WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring And Versioning) server.
Information: Gives SAS additional information about the program data vector.
MISSING Statement	                                - Assigns characters in your input data to represent special missing values for numeric data.
Log Control:                                      - Alters the appearance of the SAS log.
Comment Statement	                                - Specifies the purpose of the statement or program.

SKIP Statement	                                  - Creates a blank line in the SAS log.
Operating Environment: Accesses the operating environment directly.	
X Statement	                                      - Issues an operating-environment command from within a SAS session.
Output Control: Adds titles and footnotes to your SAS output; delivers output in a variety of formats.
FOOTNOTE Statement	                              - Writes up to 10 lines of text at the bottom of the procedure or DATA step output.
TITLE Statement	                                  - Specifies title lines for SAS output.
Program Control: Governs how SAS processes your SAS program.
CHECKPOINT EXECUTE_ALWAYS Statement	              - Indicates to execute the DATA step or PROC step that immediately follows without considering the checkpoint-restart data.
DM Statement	                                    - Submits SAS Program Editor, Log, Procedure Output or text editor commands as SAS statements.
ENDSAS Statement	                                - Terminates a SAS job or session after the current DATA or PROC step executes.
